This small application presents magnetoelectric coupling in Ni/PZN-PT multiferroic heterostructure. You can apply electric field in three different directions and observe how the direction of magnetization evolve as a consequence of changes of the free energy of the Ni layer. It is possible to obtain reversible and irreversible magnetization switching with the electric field.
